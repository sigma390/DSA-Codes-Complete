// PROGRAM 20
// Training for sports day has begun and the physical education teacher has decided to conduct some team games. The
// teacher wants to split the students in higher secondary into equal sized teams. In some cases, there may be some
// students who are left out from the teams and he wanted to use the left out students to assist him in conducting the
// team games. For instance, if there are 50 students in a class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal sized
// teams, 7 students will be there in each team and 1 student will be left out. That 1 student will assist the PET. With
// this idea in mind, the PET wants your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?
// INPUT FORMAT: Input consists of 2 integers. The first integer corresponds to the number of students in the class
// and the second integer corresponds to the number of teams.
// OUTPUT FORMAT: The output consists of two integers. The first integer corresponds to the number of students
// in each team and the second integer corresponds to the students who are left out.
// SAMPLE INPUT:
// 60
// 8
// SAMPLE OUTPUT:
// 7
// 4
