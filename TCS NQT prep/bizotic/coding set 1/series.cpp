// Consider the following series: 1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16,81,32,243,64,729,128,2187â€¦
// This series is a mixture of 2 series - all the odd terms in this series forms one series and all the even terms forms yet
// another series. Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.
// The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program
// should be written to STDOUT. Other than value of nth term, no other character / string or message should be
// written to STDOUT.
// Test Case 1

// 5
// Output
// 4
