// // virtual functions in C++ are member functions that you expect to be redefined
//  in derived classes. When you use a virtual function,
//   the function that is called is determined at runtime, which is known as runtime
//    polymorphism or dynamic dispatch.
// // Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate
//  the concept of virtual functions and runtime polymorphism.
